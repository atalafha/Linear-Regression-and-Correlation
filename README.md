# Linear Regression and Correlation: A Shiny App

Visualize the relationship between correlation and its impact on linear regression using a dynamic scatter plot.

## Introduction

This Shiny application allows users to adjust the correlation coefficient using a slider. As the correlation changes, the application generates synthetic data points to match the specified correlation and displays a scatter plot along with the corresponding linear regression line.

## Features

- **Interactive Correlation Slider**: Adjust the correlation coefficient between -1 and 1 to see how it affects the data points and regression line.
- **Dynamic Scatter Plot**: As you move the slider, the scatter plot updates in real-time, providing a visual representation of data points based on the chosen correlation coefficient.
- **Linear Regression Line**: The red line on the scatter plot shows the linear regression fit based on the synthetic data points.
